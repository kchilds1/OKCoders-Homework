			<p>The Coffee Pot has been a caring company from the very beginning. We care about who we are, who we serve
				and
				what we do. We want every guest to walk away from The Coffee Pot having experienced genuine and sincere
				customer service that puts a smile on their face and makes them just plain feel better.

				Coffee shops occupy an important space in many of our lives because of their unique ability to fulfill
				so
				many of our needs: socializing, studying, working, resting, reading â€” in an atmosphere that suits our
				tastes
				and makes us feel like we belong. At their best, coffee shops are places that meet the needs of a
				community,
				while giving communities the space they need to get together.

				This sense of community is what The Coffee Pot is all about. In fact, the atmosphere that makes The
				Coffee
				Pot so special was created to be a complete 180 from the stuffy reputation that specialty coffee shops
				rightly or wrongly deserve.</p>
